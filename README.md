DMS stands for Debt Management System. A project I created to help 
both business people and debtors track and manage their debts and debtors respectively. 

It is a web application built on top of the flask framework deployed 
using linux server: nginx and gunicorn. This project has helped me to 
solidify my understanding of web architectures, web servers, python with flask and html, css + javascript. Also i employed the help of bootstrap and jquery.

This is my first project as part of my alx software engineering journey
